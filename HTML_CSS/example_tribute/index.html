          Muhammad Yunus, a name synonymous with microfinance and poverty alleviation, stands as a towering figure in the fight for economic justice. Born in Bangladesh in 1940, Yunus witnessed firsthand the struggles of the poor and envisioned a world where financial exclusion wouldn't limit potential. His revolutionary concept, Grameen Bank, challenged traditional banking norms and empowered millions, particularly women, to break free from the cycle of poverty.

          <p>
            "Once poverty is gone, we'll need to build museums to display its
            horrors to future generations. They'll wonder why poverty continued
            so long in human society - how a few people could live in luxury
            while billions dwelt in misery, deprivation and despair."
